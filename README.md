Attached files were directly imported from project's directory. IDE: Visual Studio 2019.

Basic focus was to understand the implementation of Huffman Encoding Algorithm on Text files.

An input file was taken to generate a Binary Tree using Priority Queue on frequency of characters appearing in the file. Then, the file was encoded using the tree. Lastly, for decompression, same tree file was used to decode the information that was encoded earlier.
